Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #2,So do I. Terrific animals. Terrific.
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,MORRIS,No trouble.
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #2,"No, no trouble."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #1,"Except at shearing. They can play up a bit, then;
        can't they?"
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,MORRIS,"Oh, yeah, but I like that sort of little burst of
        frenzy they have then, you know. I like it when they get a little bit
        angry. Shows they're human."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #1,"Oh, yeah. I-- I-- I'm not saying I dislike them
        at shearing, you know, but they can be a bit of a handful; can't they?"
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,MORRIS,"Well, so would you be if you had a great pair of
        scissors snippin' away while someone held your back legs apart."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #1,Hm.
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,MORRIS,"You'd wiggle a bit. You'd kick up a bit of a fuss.
        Heh."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #1,"Yeah, I-- I'm not saying I just expect them to
        stand around in the fields and nibble the grass and look a bit pretty.
        I-- I'm not saying that."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #2,"Oh, but they are pretty; aren't they?"
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,MORRIS,Yeah.
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #1,"Oh, yeah."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #2,"I mean, look at that one over there against the
        sky. The white of the coat, the little black face against the twinkling
        stars beyond."

        anything. Little white furry bundles."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #1,Mhmm.
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,MORRIS,"I think, of all God's creatures, sheep have the best
        offspring."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #2,"Oh, yes. Terrific animals."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,MORRIS,Mm.
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #2,Terrific.

Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #1,Are they quick-witted?
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,MORRIS,"Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're quite, uh, quick-witted."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #1,Mhm.
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #2,Always cheerful. Hmm.
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #1,"Well, except at shearing. Hehhehheh."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,MORRIS,Why are you always on about shearing?
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #1,"I'm not always on about it, Morris."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,MORRIS,"You are a great deflator, you are."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #1,He was--
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,MORRIS,"Of all the moments in their little lives, you
        unerringly put your finger on the one moment where they lose a little
        bit of dignity. Well, I regard that as cheap, quite honestly."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #2,"Oh, look! Look. One of them's looking up at us.
        Heh. He knows we're talkin' about him. sniff"
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #1,"Morris, don't get me wrong. I actually like their
        behavior at shearing. I actually like them when they get a little bit
        cross. I find that endearing."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,MORRIS,"That's the fantastic thing. They're beautiful to look
        at, well-disposed, quite quick-witted, and yet, tough as nails."

Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #2,"You know, I can't think of anything I'd rather do
        than watch sheep."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,MORRIS,Mmm.
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #1,"The only other animals that I would be remotely
        interested in watching would be cats."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,MORRIS,They don't have flocks of cats.
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #1,"No, I-- I'm not saying they do, Morris."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,MORRIS,"Can you imagine a herds of cats waiting to be sheared?
        Meow! Meow! Woo hoo hoo."
Life of Brian,1,The Relationship of Men and Sheep,dialogue,SHEPHERD #2,Shh! Shh. I heard something over there.

The Meaning of Life,4,Middle Age,dialogue,MRS. HENDY,No. Burt Bacharach writes it.

        And things seem hard or tough, [clunk]
        And people are stupid, obnoxious, or daft,
        And you feel that you've had quite enough, [boom] [singing]
        Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
        And revolving at nine hundred miles an hour,
        That's orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned,
        A sun that is the source of all our power.
        The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see
        Are moving at a million miles a day
        In an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hour,
        Of the galaxy we call the 'Milky Way'.
        Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars.
        It's a hundred thousand light years side to side.
        It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick,
        But out by us, it's just three thousand light years wide.
        We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point.
        We go 'round every two hundred million years,
        And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions
        In this amazing and expanding universe. [boom] [slurp]
        The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
        In all of the directions it can whizz
        As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know,
        Twelve million miles a minute, and that's the fastest speed there is.

        So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure,
        How amazingly unlikely is your birth,

        Two: matter is energy. In the universe, there are many energy fields
        which we cannot normally perceive. Some energies have a spiritual source
        which act upon a person's soul. However, this soul does not exist ab
        initio, as orthodox Christianity teaches. It has to be brought into
        existence by a process of guided self-observation. However, this is
        rarely achieved, owing to man's unique ability to be distracted from
        spiritual matters by everyday trivia. [pause]"

        A sun that is the source of all our power.
        The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see
        Are moving at a million miles a day
        In an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hour,
        Of the galaxy we call the 'Milky Way'.
        Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars.
        It's a hundred thousand light years side to side.
        It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick,
        But out by us, it's just three thousand light years wide.
        We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point.
        We go 'round every two hundred million years,
        And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions
        In this amazing and expanding universe.
        The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
        In all of the directions it can whizz
        As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know,
        Twelve million miles a minute, and that's the fastest speed there is.
