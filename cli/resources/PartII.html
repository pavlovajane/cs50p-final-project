        before the third hour, and so, the Midianites went forth to Ram Gilead 
        in Kadesh Bilgemath, by Shor Ethra Regalion, to the house of 
        Gash-Bil-Bethuel-Bazda, he who brought the butter dish to Balshazar and 
        the tent peg to the house of Rashomon, and there slew they the goats, 
        yea, and placed they the bits in little pots. Here endeth the lesson.

        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Now, two boys have been found rubbing linseed oil 
        into the school cormorant. Now, some of you may feel that the cormorant 
        does not play an important part in the life of the school, but I would 
        remind you that it was presented to us by the Corporation of the town of 
        Sudbury to commemorate Empire Day, when we try to remember the names of 
        all those from the Sudbury area who so gallantly gave their lives to 
        keep China British. So, from now on, the cormorant is strictly out of 
        bounds! Oh, and Jenkins, apparently your mother died this morning.

        Now, before I begin the lesson, will those of you who are playing in the 
        match this afternoon move your clothes down onto the lower peg 
        immediately after lunch, before you write your letter home, if you're 
        not getting your hair cut, unless you've got a younger brother who is 
        going out this weekend as the guest of another boy, in which case, 
        collect his note before lunch, put it in your letter after you've had 
        your hair cut, and make sure he moves your clothes down onto the lower 
        peg for you. Now,-- </p>
        <p><span class="name">WYMER:</span> Sir? </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Yes, Wymer? </p>

        weekend, sir, but I'm not having my hair cut today, sir. </p>
        <p><span class="name">PUPILS:</span> <i>[chuckling]</i> </p>
        <p><span class="name">WYMER:</span> So, do I move my clothes down, or-- </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> I do wish you'd listen, Wymer. It's perfectly 
        simple. If you're not getting your hair cut, you don't have to move your 
        brother's clothes down to the lower peg. You simply collect his note 
        before lunch, after you've done your scripture prep, when you've written 
        your letter home, before rest, move your own clothes onto the lower peg, 
        greet the visitors, and report to Mr. Viney that you've had your chit 
        signed. Now, sex. Sex, sex, sex. Where were we? <i>[sniff]</i> Well, had 
        I got as far as the penis entering the vagina? <i>[sniff]</i> </p>
        <p><span class="name">PUPILS:</span> Umm. Mmmm. <br>

        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Well, had I done foreplay? <br>

        doubt you can tell me what the purpose of foreplay is,... Biggs. </p>
        <p><span class="name">BIGGS:</span> Uhm-- Don't know. Sorry, sir. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Carter. </p>
        <p><span class="name">CARTER:</span> Ah. Uhh, was it taking your clothes off, sir? </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Well, and-- and after that? </p>
        <p><span class="name">WYMER:</span> Ooh. Putting them on the lower peg, sir? </p>
        <p><span class="name">PUPILS:</span> <i>[chuckling]</i> <br>
        <i>[whop]</i> </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> The purpose of foreplay is to cause the vagina to 
        lubricate, so that the penis can penetrate more easily. </p>
        <p><span class="name">WATSON:</span> Could we have a window open, please, sir? </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Yes. Harris, will you? And, of course, to cause the 
        man's penis to erect and har... den! <i>[sniff]</i> Now, did I do 
        vaginal juices last week? Oh, do pay attention, Wadsworth! I know it's 
        Friday after-- Oh, watching the football, are you boy? Right! Move over 
        there. I'm warning you! I may decide to set an exam this term. </p>
        <p><span class="name">WATSON:</span> Oh, sir. </p>
        <p><span class="name">BIGGS:</span> Oh, sir. </p>
        <p><span class="name">PUPILS:</span> Oh, sir... </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> So, just listen. Now, did I or did I not... do... 
        vaginal... juices? </p>
        <p><span class="name">PUPILS:</span> Mmm. Mmm. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Name two ways of getting them flowing, Watson. </p>
        <p><span class="name">WATSON:</span> R-- rubbing the clitoris, sir? </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> What's wrong with a kiss, boy? Hmm? Why not start 
        her off with a nice kiss? You don't have to go leaping straight for the 
        clitoris like a bull at a gate. Give her a kiss, boy. </p>
        <p><span class="name">WYMER:</span> Suck the nipple, sir? </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Good! Good. Well done, Wymer. </p>
        <p><span class="name">DUCKWORTH:</span> Uh, stroking the thighs, sir. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Yes. Yes, I suppose so. Hmm? </p>
        <p><span class="name">PUPIL IN FRONT:</span> Oh, sir. Biting the neck. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Yes. Good. Nibbling the earlobe, uhh, kneading the 
        buttocks, and so on and so forth. So, we have all these possibilities 
        before we stampede towards the clitoris, Watson. </p>
        <p><span class="name">WATSON:</span> Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Now, all these forms of stimulation can now take 
        place,... <br>

        <i>[twong]</i> <br>
        ...and, of course, tongueing will give you the best idea of how the 
        juices are coming along. Helen! Now, penetration and coitus-- That is to 
        say, intercourse up to, and including, orgasm. Ah, hello, dear. Do stand 
        up when my wife enters the room, Carter! </p>
        <p><span class="name">CARTER:</span> Oh, sorry, sir. Sorry. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HELEN WILLIAMS:</span> Humphrey, I hope you don't mind, but I told 
        the Garfields we would dine with them tonight. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Yes. Yes, well, I suppose we must. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HELEN:</span> And I said we'd be there by eight. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Well, at least it'll give me a reason to wind up the 
        staff meeting. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HELEN:</span> Well, I know you don't like them, but I couldn't make 
        another excuse. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Well, it's just that I felt n-- Wymer! This is for 
        your benefit. Would you kindly wake up? I've no intention of going 
        through this all again. </p>
        <p><span class="name">WYMER:</span> Ahhh. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Uhh, we'll take the foreplay as read, if you don't 
        mind, dear. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HELEN:</span> No, of course not, Humphrey. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> So, the man starts by entering-- or mounting-- his 
        good lady wife in the standard way. Uh, the penis is now, as you will 
        observe, more or less, fully erect. There we are. Ah, that's better. 
        Now,-- Carter. </p>
        <p><span class="name">CARTER:</span> Yes, sir? </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> What is it? </p>
        <p><span class="name">CARTER:</span> It's an ocarina, sir. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Bring it up here. The man now starts making 
        thrusting movements with his pelvic area, moving the penis up and down 
        inside the vagina, so-- Put it there, boy. Put it there on the table.
        <br>
        <i>[clunk]</i> <br>
        While the wife maximizes her clitoral stimulation by the shaft of the 
        penis by pushing forward,-- Thank you, dear. Now, as sexual... </p>
        <p><span class="name">BIGGS:</span> <i>[chuckling]</i> </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> ...excitement mounts, uh,-- What's funny, Biggs? </p>
        <p><span class="name">BIGGS:</span> Uh,-- Oh, nothing, sir. </p>
        <p><span class="name">HUMPHREY:</span> Oh, do please share your little joke with the rest 
        of us. I mean, obviously something frightfully funny's going on. </p>
